# BaseHub Scripts for Roblox
⚠️ **Some scripts are outdated and may not work.**

BaseHub Scripts is an ***incomplete collection*** of *some* of the scripts which were available in BaseHub for Roblox.

## What is BaseHub?
BaseHub is a multi-platform coding/hacking/reverse engineering tool which allows you to do things that weren't intended to be done by the developer. In the instance of videogames, run unsigned code, alter memory values, comfortably modify save files and extract game content.

**BaseHub for Roblox** is the Roblox edition of BaseHub, a small GUI which compiles some of the greatest scripts into one big solution.

## ⛔️ Roblox and Byfron
As of 2023, Roblox has taken a firm stance against cheating and exploiting on its platform. This commitment was emphasised in [a recent blog post](https://devforum.roblox.com/t/exploit-prevention-update/2663101) where Roblox addressed the ongoing battle against unauthorised activities.

### Roblox's Stance on Cheating and Exploiting
In a blog post, Roblox declared its unwavering dedication to combating cheating and exploiting within the Roblox ecosystem. The company highlighted recent ban waves that resulted in the removal of hundreds of thousands of players engaging in such activities. Moreover, Roblox expressed its determination to continue these ban waves until a positive shift in player behaviour is observed.

### A Strategic Partnership with Synapse Softworks LLC
In an unexpected move, Roblox announced a close partnership with Synapse Softworks LLC, a well-known entity in the Roblox exploiting scene. Synapse is recognized for its expertise in understanding the security challenges posed by exploiting activities. The partnership aims to leverage Synapse's skills and knowledge to reinforce the platform's security and mitigate potential threats.

While the collaboration may seem unconventional given the historical opposition, Roblox emphasized that the partnership with Synapse is a strategic move toward achieving the overarching goal of making Roblox the most trusted, safe, and fair environment possible. The partnership is viewed as a significant step forward in bridging the gap between the platform and the reverse engineering community.
